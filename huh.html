<p style="font-size: 2.5em;"> The world of finance can be a complex and unpredictable place, historical economic crashes are still talked about to this day.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 2.5em;">Fear of the next 2008 or worse, the next great depression have been running rife in recent times and in some cases have caused significant 
    changes in governmental policies and actions. 
The main issue is however, that the centralised banks still have the majority of the say in financial policies and how our money is controlled. Unfortunately errors made by banks are the reason for most significant
economic downfalls throughout history.</p>
<p style="font-size: 2.5em;">But what if I told you that there was a solution to the mismanagement of centralised banking and that solution is in the form of digital currency, or it's more common name "cryptocurrency".</p>
<p>ㅤ</p>
<P>ㅤ</P>
<p>ㅤ</p>
<p style="font-size: 3.5em;">Evaluating the use of cryptocurrency to replace centralised banking</p>
<p style="font-size: 2.5em;">Cryptocurrency has been seen as an alternative to centralised currency for over two decades however, only in recent years has it blown up in popularity.
  Cryptocurrency is an encrypted form of regular currency that can be transferred between two parties without the use of a middleman, cryptocurrencies are notable for their low fees and fast speeds
  and with thousands of cryptocurrencies available there is likely one that suits you.
</p>
<P>ㅤ</P>
<p>ㅤ</p>
<p style="font-size: 3.5em;">The advantages of cryptocurrency:</p>
<p style="font-size: 2.5em;">Low costs and no middleman mean that it is perfect for securely transferring large sums of money without worries of the middleman scamming you.</p>
<p style="font-size: 2.5em;">A uniquely high level of discretion on crypto transactions ensures that people cannot be tracked by those with malicious intent, thus it is also more private than centralised banking.</p>
<p style="font-size: 2.5em;">The largest cryptocurrencies have generally gone up by over hundereds of times their value from just a decade ago, with this trend likely to continue as it becomes more and more popular
  it is truly just the gift that keeps on giving
</p>
<P>ㅤ</P>
<p>ㅤ</p>
<p style="font-size: 3.5em;">The disadvantages of cryptocurrency:</p>
<p style="font-size: 2.5em;">Whilst cryptocurrency generally increases in value overtime, the value of the crypto market is fairly volatile, as it becomes more popular the volatility shoud ease though.</p>
<p style="font-size: 2.5em;">As governments are opposed to decentralisation crypto remains unregulated. This means there is no governmental protection from scams, although they are easy to spot.</p>
<P>ㅤ</P>
<p>ㅤ</p>
<p style="font-size: 3.5em;">So is cryptocurrency really the solution to centralised banks mismanaging our money?</p>
<p style="font-size: 2.5em;">To put it simply, no. There will always be a reason to worry about the next financial crash, and there will always be someone mismanaging our money... It is important though, that our money remains OUR money
  and not theirs to play around with whenever they want, this is why crypto is incredibly important to the future of finance and also why I believe that anyone reading this should atleast consider owning some crypto. Who knows, you might even 100x your money.

<!--I am aware the subject is fairly boring, apologies.
also crypto is very high risk and completely unprotected and this webpage does not reflect my views on the asset type (although it is a pretty good investment)-->
<!--The web page includes the following HTML tags:

Whilst at the time of writing i have done all of the tasks in the mark scheme i think i should continue so that the webpage actually makes sense and since the main goal is to solve a problem or write an article(?)
